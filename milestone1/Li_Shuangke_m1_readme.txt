I fully complete almost all parts but I do not complete using numbers to change speed.
But I fully implement using "W","S","A","D","Q" and"E" to control the motion mode.
Also for "up","down","left" and "right" keys.

Note:
I set left shift key as "walk" and "run" switch mode key. If you do not hit left shift it will continue as running mode.
Hit left shift key switch to walking mode.
